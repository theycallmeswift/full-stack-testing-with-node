# Full Stack Integration Testing with Node.js

This repo contains the slides and sample code from my talk at CodeMash 2013.
The talk was called "Full Stack Integration Testing with Node.js".

The talk walks you through my journey of learning to test my applications with
a headless browser powered by Node and javascript.  Besides the added speed
and familiar API, we also get the advantage of truely decoupled tests. Sweet.
